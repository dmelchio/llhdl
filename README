LLHDL - Low Level Hardware Description Language
An experimental logic synthesis infrastructure for FPGAs.

(C) Copyright 2010 Sebastien Bourdeauducq.
Released under GNU GPL version 3. See file COPYING.

Build requirements:
 * clang
 * cmake
 * re2c
 * lemon

Build/installation instructions:
 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
 # make install

Then you can try the example designs in the "designs" folder. Xilinx ISE is
still needed for the place and route and bitstream encoding phases.

NOTE: This is highly experimental work in progress. As of today, many Verilog
features do not work, the netlist is not optimized and the internal APIs not
guaranteed to be stable.
